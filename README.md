For the fist "bigger" web project I decided for combination of Vue.js (Nuxt) and Django.

Wishlist is a simple website where you can register and then add items with details you wish to have.

Features: 
- both backend and fronted dockerized
- various item filters
- navigation guards
- authentication (jwt)
- error messages and dialogs depending on the state
- form validation
- pagination

TBD:
- properly working responsiveness
- password reset by email
